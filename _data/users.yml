Thus I naturally became interested in open source databases. And since PostgreSQL is declared to be the most advanced open source database, I focussed on it. When working on a feature that needs to be split into multiple diff files, I create one branch per diff and use a shell script to compare the “adjacent” branches and to generate the diffs. Other scripts take care of merging (both local and upstream) changes into the individual branches. "
