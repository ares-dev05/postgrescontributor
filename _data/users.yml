Thus I naturally became interested in open source databases. And since PostgreSQL is declared to be the most advanced open source database, I focussed on it. When working on a feature that needs to be split into multiple diff files, I create one branch per diff and use a shell script to compare the “adjacent” branches and to generate the diffs. Other scripts take care of merging (both local and upstream) changes into the individual branches. "

  about: "Portuguese: Atualmente eu ajudo pessoas e times a aproveitar o máximo do potencial dos bancos de dados relacionais, em especial o PostgreSQL, apoiando as equipes desde a concepção da estrutura de um banco de dados (modeling), passando pela arquitetura física (database schema), programação (procedural languages), SQL (uso, tunning, boas práticas), otimização e orquestração de instâncias em produção. Realizo trabalhos voluntários para Comunidade Brasileira de PostgreSQL, apoiando nas listas de discussão, organização de eventos e administração da mesma. Também ajudo o PostgreSQL Global Development Group (PGDG) na implementação de algumas funcionalidades e revisão de patches. "
